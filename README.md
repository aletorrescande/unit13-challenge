# unit13-challenge

The objective is to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan based on the level of risk the user is willing to take.

It is done by completing the following tasks:
1) Building and testing an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent and four slots to establish a conversation about the requirements needed for the suggestion of portfolio.
2) Enhancing the Robo Advisor with an Amazon Lambda Function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation.(See Lamda Function)

## Result
You can download the video of the final output under the Recording Folder. The json_exports folder contains the json formats of the bot, intent and slots.
